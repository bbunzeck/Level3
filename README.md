# Level3

Shiny App to explore a scatterplot of tokens connected to a scatterplot of their context words.
This includes information on HDBSCAN clusters of the tokens and the representativity of the context words
in terms of these clusters.
It's a 'fancier' version of Level 3 of [this visualization](https://github.com/qlvl/NephoVis/).
